# About

This is SPaNT! If you're watching streamers on the other side of the world, or you're just tired and fall asleep while watching your favourite Twitch streamer, this app can help save some power! 
Just enter the twitch username of the streamer and you don't have to worry about turning your pc off later ;)

## How to install/run
First, make sure you have at least Java 17 installed.

For Windows users, you can download the exe from Githubs "releases" tab and you're ready to go.
For every other OS, you can download the jar file, also from the releases tab, and either double click it to run, or in the command line in the same folder as the jar type:
`java -jar SPaNT-[version].jar`



### Legal Notice
I do not work with Twitch and this project is not a part of it, the name "Twitch" and the Twitch logo belongs to Twitch Interactive, Inc.
